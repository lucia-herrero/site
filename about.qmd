### About Me 

![](img/momo.jpg){style="float: right; top: 0px; padding: 20px" fig-align="right" width=45%}


My name is Lucia Herrero, and I am a second-year graduate student in the Cognition, Affect and Temperament Lab at Penn State University. I am pursuing a Dual-Title doctoral degree in Developmental Psychology and Social and Behavioral Neuroscience.


As a first-gen college graduate and second-gen Mexican-American, my lived experiences directly inform the lens through which I conduct my work. I see my participation in academia as a process of gaining self-knowledge and an opportunity to give back to the myriad communities to which I belong. I am committed to increasing accessibility and support for minoritized students and study populations. My ultimate goal as a researcher is to cultivate collaborative relationships through the dynamic exchange of ideas and resources to build a more equitable and just world.  


In my free time, I enjoy being in nature, reading, and trying new foods and recipes. I am absolutely obsessed with my shiba, Momo üêæ
