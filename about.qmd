### About Me 

My name is Lucia Herrero, and I am a second-year graduate student in the Cognition, Affect and Temperament Lab at Penn State University. I am pursuing a Dual-Title doctoral degree in Developmental Psychology and Social and Behavioral Neuroscience.


As a first-gen college graduate and second-gen Mexican-American, I am committed to increasing accessibility and support for minoritized students and study populations. My lived experiences at the intersection of many unique identities directly inform the lens through which I conduct my work. I see my participation in academia as a process of gaining self-knowledge and an opportunity to give back to the communities to which I belong. My ultimate goal as a researcher is to cultivate collaborative relationships through the dynamic exchange of ideas and resources to build a more equitable and just world.  

In my free time, I enjoy being in nature, reading, and trying new foods and recipes. I am absolutely obsessed with my shiba, Momo üêæ
