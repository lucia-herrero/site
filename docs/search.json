    "text": "Current Work\n\n\n\nConceptual Model of Dyadic Social Dynamics as a Mechanism for Parent-Child Anxiety Transmission\n\n\nThrough the NIMH Diversity Supplement, I am investigating the moment-to-moment dyadic social dynamics between parents and children that potentiate risk for anxiety transmission. I am interested in the bi-directional, transactional nature of these interactions, and particularly, how children might support anxious parents during stressful tasks. I aim to understand how neural (fNIRS), physiological (RSA), and behavioral responses across the dyad converge, diverge, and cascade over the course of an interaction and how these varying levels of synchrony predict anxiety.\nIn support of this work, I lead a behavioral observation coding team. With members of the CAT Lab, I developed a behavioral coding protocol specific to the Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation Schedule (DBDOS) to evaluate affect, verbal and non-verbal interactions, parent emotion socialization strategies, and child responses to parent negative behavior. This protocol is currently being implemented to process pilot (R56 MH130007) and main study (R01 MH130007) DBDOS behavioral data.\n\n\nInterests\nNeurodevelopment of emotion regulation; intergenerational psychopathology risk; sociocultural resilience; Latine mental health; developmental social, cognitive, and affective neuroscience (DSCAN)\n\n\nPublications\nPsychology\nMcCrea, C.

    "text": "About Me\n\n\n\n\n\nMy name is Lucia Herrero, and I am a second-year graduate student in the Cognition, Affect and Temperament Lab at Penn State University. I am pursuing a Dual-Title doctoral degree in Developmental Psychology and Social and Behavioral Neuroscience.\nAs a first-gen college graduate and second-gen Mexican-American, I am committed to increasing accessibility and support for minoritized students and study populations. My lived experiences at the intersection of many unique identities directly inform the lens through which I conduct my work. I see my participation in academia as a process of gaining self-knowledge and an opportunity to give back to the communities to which I belong. My ultimate goal as a researcher is to cultivate collaborative relationships through the dynamic exchange of ideas and resources to build a more equitable and just world.\nIn my free time, I enjoy being in nature, reading, and trying new foods and recipes. I am absolutely obsessed with my shiba, Momo üêæ"
