### Current Work

![ Conceptual Model of Dyadic Social Dynamics as a Mechanism for Parent-Child Anxiety Transmission](img/pcat_conceptual_model.png){width=80%}

Through the NIMH Diversity Supplement (R01 MH130007), I am investigating the moment-to-moment dyadic social dynamics between parents and children that potentiate risk for anxiety transmission. I am interested in the bi-directional, transactional nature of these interactions, and particularly, how children might support anxious parents during stressful tasks. I aim to
understand how neural \(fNIRS), physiological \(RSA), and behavioral responses across the dyad converge, diverge, and cascade over the course of an interaction and how these varying levels of synchrony predict anxiety.


In support of this work, I lead a behavioral observation coding team. With members of the CAT Lab, I developed a behavioral coding protocol specific to the Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation Schedule (DBDOS) to evaluate affect, verbal and non-verbal interactions, parent emotion socialization strategies, and child responses to parent negative behavior. This protocol is currently being implemented to process pilot (R56 MH130007) and main study (R01 MH130007) DBDOS behavioral data.
