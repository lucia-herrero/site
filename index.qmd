## Welcome!

I am an NIMH Diversity Supplement Scholar using a multi-method approach to investigate the neurodevelopment of emotion regulation. Particularly, I am interested in understanding how environmental, intergenerational, and sociocultural risk and protective factors influence emotion regulation development.
